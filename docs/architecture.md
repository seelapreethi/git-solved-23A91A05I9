# System Architecture

## Overview
DevOps Simulator follows a microservices architecture designed for high availability and scalability. This document covers both production and development configurations.

## Components

### 1. Application Server
- **Technology**: Node.js + Express
- **Production Port**: 8080
- **Development Port**: 3000
- **Scaling**: Horizontal auto-scaling (production only)
- **Development Features**: Hot reload, debug mode

### 2. Database Layer
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14
- **Production**: Master-slave replication with automated backups
- **Development**: Single local instance with seed data

### 3. Monitoring System
- **Production**: Prometheus + Grafana with email alerts
- **Development**: Console logging with verbose output
- **Metrics**: CPU, Memory, Disk, Network

## Deployment Strategy

### Production
- **Method**: Rolling updates
- **Zero-downtime**: Yes
- **Rollback**: Automated on failure
- **Region**: us-east-1

### Development
- **Method**: Docker Compose
- **Features**: Hot reload, instant feedback
- **Testing**: Automated tests before deployment

## Security
- **Production**: SSL/TLS encryption, strict access controls
- **Development**: Relaxed security for easier debugging

> ## üß™ Experimental Build (Commented Section)
> 
> The following describes **experimental architecture** enhancements under research/testing:
> 
> - Event-driven microservices with **AI/ML integration**
> - Multi-cloud deployments and chaos engineering
> - AI-powered **predictive auto-scaling**
> - Real-time **ML inference** using TensorFlow.js
> - Distributed PostgreSQL + Redis with AI-based optimization
> - **Kubernetes orchestration** with multi-cloud failover
> - Enhanced **observability** via Prometheus + Thanos + ELK Stack + AI log analysis
>
> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Note: These features are experimental and not yet production-ready.*

### üßπ After Cleaning:
1. **Save** the file (e.g., `ARCHITECTURE.md`)
2. Run these in terminal:
   ```bash
   git add ARCHITECTURE.md
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in ARCHITECTURE.md - kept stable and documented experimental section"
